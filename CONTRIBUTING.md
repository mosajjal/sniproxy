## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We aim to maintain a welcoming and inclusive community.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your changes
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.5 or later
- Git
- (Optional) Docker for containerized testing

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sniproxy.git
cd sniproxy

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mosajjal/sniproxy.git

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the project
go build -v ./cmd/sniproxy/

# Run tests
go test -v ./...
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/your-feature-name` - For new features
- `fix/bug-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/what-you-updated` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/what-you-refactored` - For code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Add detailed description after a blank line if needed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

Example:
```
Add IPv6 support for DoH queries

- Implement IPv6 address handling in DNS client
- Update pickSrcAddr to support IPv6 preferences
- Add tests for IPv6 connectivity

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -cover ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test -v ./pkg/acl/

# Run a specific test
go test -v -run TestDNSClient_lookupDomain4 ./pkg/
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test error cases and edge conditions

Example:
```go
func TestNewFeature(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid input", "test", "expected", false},
        {"invalid input", "", "", true},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := NewFeature(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("NewFeature() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("NewFeature() = %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Code Style

### Go Standards

- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use `goimports` to manage imports
- Run `go vet` before submitting

### Linting

We use golangci-lint for additional code quality checks:

```bash
# Install golangci-lint
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest

# Run linter
golangci-lint run
```

### Documentation

- Add godoc comments for all exported functions, types, and constants
- Keep comments concise but descriptive
- Update README.md if you add new features or change behavior
- Add examples for complex functionality

Example:
```go
// ProcessRequest handles incoming HTTP requests and proxies them to the origin server.
// It performs ACL checks, DNS resolution, and applies configured transformations.
//
// Parameters:
//   - c: Configuration object containing proxy settings
//   - req: The incoming HTTP request to process
//
// Returns an error if the request cannot be processed or ACL denies the connection.
func ProcessRequest(c *Config, req *http.Request) error {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Update your branch with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

2. Push your changes to your fork:

   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. Create a pull request on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what changed and why
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots/logs if applicable

4. Wait for review and address any feedback
