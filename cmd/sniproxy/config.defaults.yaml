# you can use environment variables to override the settings provided int he default config or the config file as well
# to do that use the `SNIPROXY_` prefix, followed by the full tree of the parameter you need to update, separated by two underscores (__)
# for example, if you want the dns server to be bounded to 0.0.0.0:5555 rather than the default 0.0.0.0:53, you run the sniproxy (or the container)
# with the following environment variable
# SNIPROXY_GENERAL__BIND_DNS_OVER_UDP=0.0.0.0:5555

  # 1. if mmdb is not loaded or not available, it's fail-open (allow by default)
  # 2. if the IP can't be resolved to a country, it's rejected
  # 3. if the country is in the blocked list, it's rejected
  # 4. if the country is in the allowed list, it's allowed
  # note that the reject list is checked first and takes priority over the allow list
  # if the IP's country doesn't match any of the above, it's allowed if the blocked list is not empty
  # for example, if the blockedlist is [US] and the allowedlist is empty, a connection from
  # CA will be allowed. but if blockedlist is empty and allowedlist is [US], a connection from
  # CA will be rejected.
